# LINFO1252 : SystÃ¨me Informatique Ù­ Projet1
ðŸ“… 8 dÃ©cembre 2024.

In this project, we had to evaluate and explain the performance of applications using **multiple threads** and **synchronization primitives**: *mutexes*, *semaphores* (first part) as well as *locks* with ***active waiting***, which we implemented ourselves (second part). 
 
The applications considered are: **philosophers' problem**, **producers/consumers** with a *fixed buffer* size, and **readers/writers** with *writers' priority*. We'll look at total execution time, varying the number of execution threads, and for a fixed number of operations (not dependent on the number of threads). 

Information about how to run the differents files are available by making the command "make help".
